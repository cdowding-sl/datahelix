Feature: running datetimes related to otherfield datetimes

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo has type "datetime"
    And foo is anything but null
    And there is a field bar
    And bar has type "datetime"
    And bar is anything but null
    And the combination strategy is exhaustive

  Scenario: Running an "afterField" constraint allows one date to be always later than another
    Given foo is after 2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
    And bar is before 2018-09-01T00:00:00.004Z
    And there is a constraint:
