Feature: User can specify the length of generated string data using 'ofLength'

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And there is a field foo
    And foo is of type "string"

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string should be successful
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | null       |
      | <expected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected |
      | 1      | "a"      |
      | 2      | "aa"     |
      | 1.0    | "a"      |

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a negation of a valid numeric length should be successful
    Given foo is anything but of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"  |
      | "aa" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo        |
      | null       |
      | <expected> |
    Examples:
      | length | expected |
      | 1      | "aa"     |
      | 2      | "a"      |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' request on a roman alphabet character string value and white space should be successful
    Given foo is of length 10
    And foo is in set:
      | "a"          |
      | "  10  10  " |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo          |
      | null         |
      | "  10  10  " |

  Scenario: Running an 'ofLength' for a length of zero should be successful
    Given foo is of length 0
    And foo is in set:
      | ""  |
      | "a" |
    Then the following data should be generated:
      | foo  |
      | null |
      | ""   |

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a decimal number containing non zero digits should fail with an error message
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "1" |
    Then the profile is invalid because "Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be an integer but was a decimal with value `.+`"
    Examples:
      | length      |
      | 1.1         |
      | 1.01        |
      | 1.10        |
      | 1.010       |
      | 1.000000001 |
      | 1.9         |

  Scenario Outline: Running an 'ofLength' request that includes a value that is not a valid number should fail with an error
    Given foo is of length <length>
    And foo is in set:
      | "a" |
    Then the profile is invalid because "(Field \[foo\]: Couldn't recognise 'value' property, it must be an Integer but was a String with value `.*`)|(Field \[foo\]: Cannot create an StringHasLengthConstraint for field 'foo' with a a negative length.)|(Field \[foo\]: ofLength constraint must have an operand/value >= 0, currently is -?\d+)"
    And no data is created
    Examples:
      | length                    |
      | -1                        |
      | "1"                       |
      | "1.1"                     |
      | "1,000"                   |
      | "100,00"                  |
      | "010"                     |
      | "Â£1.00"                   |
      | "-1"                      |
      | "+1"                      |
      | "Infinity"                |
      | "NaN"                     |
      | "nil"                     |
      | "$1.00"                   |
      | "1E+02"                   |
      | "001 000"                 |
      | "2010-01-01T00:00:00.000" |
      | "2010-01-01T00:00"        |
      | "1st Jan 2010"            |
      | "a"                       |
      | ""                        |
