@ignore #pending development of #1235 - Allow a Numeric Field to Depend On Another Numeric Field
Feature:As a  User
        I can specify that a numeric value is greater than, less than or equal to a numeric value in a different field
        So that I can setup the test data to meet my requirements

  Background:
    Given the generation strategy is full
    And the combination strategy is minimal
    And there is a field foo
    And foo has type "integer"
    And foo is greater than 1
    And foo is anything but null
    And there is a field bar
    And bar has type "integer"
    And bar is anything but null


###Integer

  Scenario: The one where a user can specify that one number should be greater than another number
    Given bar is greater than 1
    And the generator can generate at most 3 rows
    And there is a constraint:
